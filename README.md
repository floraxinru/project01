# Project 1: MTA Turnstile Data

### Objectives
#### *Excerpt from WTWY letter to Metis (edit later):
As we mentioned, we are interested in **harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work**, which is a significant portion of our **fundraising** efforts.

**WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.**
To this end we place street teams at **entrances to subway stations**. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use **MTA subway data**, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us **optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.**
